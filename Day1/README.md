# 1st Day of Learning AVR

## Blinky

I tried to implement the blink code in Arduino way! Not efficient but works! :P 

## CyclonEyes

The blinking LEDs get lightened up by turns.

## ShowingOff

Lot of Bit manipulation and Low power consumption function used in ATmega328p

## SimpleButton
* ToggleButton
* SimpleButton
* DebounceButton

were implemented in three separate header files.
